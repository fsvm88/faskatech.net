<b>Personal Information</b><br/>
Hi all! Well well, here starts my experience as a webmaster.<br/>
My name is Fabio Scaccabarozzi, I was born in Vimercate, Italy on 20th November 1988, and there I still live with my family. I've got a brother (2 years younger than me) and no pets. I attended high schools at the local state liceum A. Banfi.<br/>
I'm a student in Electronic Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, 2nd year.<br/>
Computer science has been my passion since I was six. My dad bought me an Intel Pentium in 1994, its main function being a playbox, something like a PlayStation. I experimented with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows XP, and my main fun slowly moved from playing a game to solving Windows' errors and optimizing Windows' bottlenecks. Then came the ADSL modem. Fixed bill for unlimited traffic gave me the opportunity to browse undefinitely and learn the most out of the web.<br/>

<b>Ideals</b><br/>
I follow the hacker ethics as much as I can, that's how my mind "works". If I have to solve a problem I usually spend a lot of time documenting, searching and so on. Forums are my last resource, usually. Overall, at least learned the basic concepts of chroot jail and testing before actually setting up things (my first experiments always led to OS reinstallation). If there's somewhere I can contribute, I usually report my experiences and try to help less experienced users.<br/>
Most interesting readings about Computer science were John Cirillo's Hacker - Attack/Hacker - Defense and The art of hacking, by John Ericksson.<br/>

    <b>Tastes</b><br/>
    About personal tastes, well, my favourite movies are The Matrix trilogy, A beautiful mind and the American Pie ones. I love rock music, though I listen to almost everything (Celtic, New Age, Pop and also some Blues&amp;Jazz, House/Techno quite less). About books, I love Fantasy genre (Narnia, Harry Potter, Lord of Rings, Eragon..).<br/>
    I have also a Facebook account, if you want, you can reach me also there.<br/>

<b>Experiences</b><br/>
At some point in between 2004 and 2005 in Italy appeared a hacking magazine, called "Hacker Journal". I discovered OpenSource software, Linux and the Hacker ethics. That's the turning point in my digital life: I began experimenting with Linux, Slackware being my first distro. Slackware was a mess with management, in turn. I looked for an alternative distro with a native package manager: Mandriva screwed up my hard-drive, Debian didn't install and swaret was just a little nice script (talking of Slackware).<br/>
Then (mid ~2005) I found Gentoo: portage looked like heaven when compared to other package managers. Flexibility, regular updates and on top, semi-automatic source fetching&amp;compilation. Solving Windows' errors seemed really silly when compared to a compilation error. I learned almost everything about Gentoo. Followed the updates regularly, installed packages, moved to graphical interface, learned the tools. In the end, learned bash and began scripting. Then, with first year of university, learned C ad began modifying little parts of the kernel (power-patches) and programs (davl tools). Learned the process of creating an ebuild and created my own overlay. The status of Reiser4 support gave me the idea of creating Reiser4-enabled minimal liveCDs. And so, here we are. This is a sum of all the things I learned.<br/>

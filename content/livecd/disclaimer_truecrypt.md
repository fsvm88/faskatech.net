These liveCD releases contain only free open source code and all of these packages are bound to the GPL-v2 or GPL-v3 license (link).
I am not trying in any way to advertise my product through the name of the TrueCrypt foundation or its product. I am using the TrueCrypt name with the only intention to make public the availability of TrueCrypt in my product.
When including TrueCrypt as a part of my product, I fully agree with the TrueCrypt License.

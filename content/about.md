# About me

## Personal Information
Hi all! Well well, here starts my experience as a webmaster.  
My name is Fabio Scaccabarozzi, I was born in Vimercate, Italy on 20th November 1988. I've got a brother (2 years younger than me) and a dog named Lulù. I attended high schools at the local state liceum A. Banfi.  
Computer science has been my passion since I was six. My dad bought me an Intel Pentium in 1994, its main function being a playbox, something like a PlayStation. I experimented with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows XP, and my main fun slowly moved from playing a game to solving Windows' errors and optimizing Windows' bottlenecks. Then came the ADSL modem. Fixed bill for unlimited traffic gave me the opportunity to browse undefinitely and learn the most out of the web.

## Work
After a brief experience in a no longer existing startup near Switzerland's border in 2013, for most of 2014 I have been an employee at <a href="http://www.epress.it" target="_blank">Epress Information Services</a> and working for Esselunga S.p.A. in their head office, in Limito di Pioltello (near Milan, Italy).  
Starting December, 2014 I am an employee of <a href="https://www.forexus.ch/" target="_blank">Forexus GmbH</a> in Zürich, Switzerland. Here I am working as Junior eDiscovery Consultant, being part of the processing team in a well-known bank.  

## Ideals
I follow the hacker ethics as much as I can, that's how my mind "works". If I have to solve a problem I usually spend a lot of time documenting, searching and so on. Forums are my last resource, usually. Overall, at least learned the basic concepts of chroot jail and testing before actually setting up things (my first experiments always led to OS reinstallation). If there's somewhere I can contribute, I usually report my experiences and try to help less experienced users.  
Most interesting readings about Computer science were John Cirillo's <cite>Hacker - Attack</cite>/<cite>Hacker - Defense</cite> and <cite>The art of hacking</cite>, by John Ericksson.

## Tastes
About personal tastes, well, my favourite movies are <cite>The Matrix trilogy</cite>, <cite>A beautiful mind</cite> and the <cite>American Pie</cite> ones. I love rock music, though I listen to almost everything (Celtic, New Age, Pop and also some Blues&amp;Jazz, House/Techno quite less). About books, I love the Fantasy genre (<cite>The Chronicles of Narnia</cite>, <cite>Harry Potter</cite>, <cite>Lord of Rings</cite>, <cite>Eragon</cite>..).

## Experiences
At some point in between 2004 and 2005 in Italy appeared a hacking magazine, called "<cite>Hacker Journal</cite>". I discovered OpenSource software, Linux and the Hacker ethics. That was the turning point in my digital life: I began experimenting with Linux, <cite>Slackware</cite> being my first distro. <cite>Slackware</cite> was a mess with package management, so I looked for an alternative distro with a native package manager: <cite>Mandriva</cite> screwed up my hard-drive, <cite>Debian</cite> didn't install and Slackware's <cite>swaret</cite> was just a little nice script.  
Then, around the half of 2005, I found <cite>Gentoo</cite>: portage looked like heaven when compared to other package managers. Flexibility, regular updates and on top, automatic source fetching and compilation. Solving Windows' errors seemed really silly when compared to a compilation error. I learned almost everything about <cite>Gentoo</cite>. Followed the updates regularly, installed packages, moved to graphical interface, learned the tools. In the end, learned bash and began scripting. Then, with first year of university, learned C ad began modifying little parts of the kernel (power-patches) and programs (davl tools). Learned the process of creating an ebuild and created my own overlay. The status of <cite>Reiser4</cite> support gave me the idea of creating Reiser4-enabled minimal liveCDs. And so, here we are. This website is a sum of all the things I learned.  
After two years of inactivity, this website is now set to become my main blogging platform, assisting me in my voyage in the Open Source computing.

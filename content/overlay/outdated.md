This overlay used to contain all the ebuilds that were not present anymore in my main overlay due to the following reasons:

* newer ebuilds were available
* there was no more need to mantain the ebuild

As of Jan, 23rd 2011 this overlay has been **disabled**. This is to prevent the use of ebuilds. Most of them are so outdated that their sources are no longer available. Some other of them were meant to help the user (the web-apps ones) but the truth is that it is much easier to manually fetch and install the sources, and then manually configure all the needed services.

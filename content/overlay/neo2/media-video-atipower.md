Ebuild for atipower. There has never been an ebuild for such program. It goes back to the days when I used the fglrx driver. This little well written program has the ability to show (and select) even power/clock statuses that are hidden from the aticonfig utility. This is often the case of desktop cards that have different 2D/3D clocks. My X1900XT fan would spin down to achieve lower noise, reducing power consuption, of course. Perfect in combination with a login startup script that runs at logon to your favourite Desktop Manager. I will always keep it in my main overlay.

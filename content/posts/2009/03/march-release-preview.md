Hi all! It's been quite long since last post.

Anyway, exams at university have ended, and I finally have some time to build the new release. Lately my main concerns were headed to gcc-4.3.3, which had to be re-emerged twice on my currently working systems to function properly.
<!--MORE-->
Luckily everything went fine, and the errors I got when trying to build stage2 went away. For this release, I'm going to wait for 2.6.29 to come out and have the "official" reiser4 patches available ([link](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/edward/){:target='_blank'}), so that we'll have a brand new shining kernel. Following the kernel release times, hopefully 2.6.29 will be out for about the 2nd week of March, allowing me to meet the published release schedule. Major features will be linux-headers-2.6.28-r1, glibc-2.9_p20081201-r2 and gcc-4.3.3.

As for the stages release, judging from the actual amount of data downloaded from the server, there seems to be no need for one-month updates (afterall in 3 months we hardly have a "core" feature update). If that's the case, I'll rebuild the stages.

I'm also planning to implement two wordpress blogs on subdomains of faskatech.net, where I will transfer my actual italian blog and open a new english one (mainly about gentoo experiences), so that I'll centralize everything.

Stay tuned ;)

Cheers,
Fabio Scaccabarozzi

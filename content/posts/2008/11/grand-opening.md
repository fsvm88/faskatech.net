Well well, after a lot of time spent learning Joomla, Apache, MySQL and configuring them, I'm proud to annouce the opening of a semi-definitive site.

The main section, dedicated to my liveCDs, is ready. The other ones (being only "Scripts" right now) are still work in progress. Stay tuned for news, and update your bookmarks.

Cheers,

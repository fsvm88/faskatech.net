Hi all\!

As some of you may have noticed, we\'re almost at the middle of November and there\'s no new release available\.
The problem is that the reiser4 patches have not yet been ported to 2\.6\.36, and applying the 2\.6\.35 patchset fails miserably at compile time\.
Of course, I can\'t blame anybody for this\. Reiser4 work is being volunteered by Edward Shishkin and the 2\.6\.36 release has seen a lot of non\-obvious code changes \(most notably VFS patches and the workqueue unification patches\)\.

So, if no new patches will be available by November 14th, I\'ll be sticking to 2\.6\.35 and build the new release upon it\.

Cheers,
Fabio Scaccabarozzi

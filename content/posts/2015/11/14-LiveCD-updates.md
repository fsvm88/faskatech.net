Hi all!

A new release is finally out for the liveCDs!

Notable changes include:

* 4.2.6 kernel + reiser4 patch and btrfs delayed references patch (necessary for balance to work)
* gcc-4.9.3
* glibc 2.22-r1
* linux-headers 4.3
* added F2FS support
* added miscellaneous forensic tools (initiative coming from my new job in the eDiscovery branch)


See the full [Changelog](/livecd/changelog/) for additional details.


Cheers,  
Fabio Scaccabarozzi
